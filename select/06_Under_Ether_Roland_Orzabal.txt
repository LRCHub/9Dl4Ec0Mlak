Someone said the world was under ether
Better bet your bottom dollar
Better bet your bottom dollar
That before your eyes we turn to dust
Bodies rearranged

Someone said the world was all but dried out
Read it on the walls around you
Waiting for the paint to dry
Well you might not have to wait very long

Talk about it
Think about it hey!

Ether stole your thoughts while you were sleeping
Came in through an open window
Looking for an open mind
And it wiped that smile right off your face
Rock n' roll radiate

Talk about it
Think about it hey!

Under ether
Under ether...
